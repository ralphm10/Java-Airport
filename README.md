# Java Airport

This is a simplified version of the [Aiport Challenge](https://github.com/ralphm10/airport_challenge) that I completed as part of the [Makers](http://makers.tech/) bootcamp in software engineering. 

The previous version was completed in Ruby but this time I have used Java as part of my process for learning the language, and specifically to gain understanding and experience in mocking using [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito), raising exceptions and testing with [Junit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5), and using some [AssertJ](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core) assertions.
